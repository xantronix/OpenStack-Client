=head1 NAME

OpenStack::Client - A cute little client to OpenStack services

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #
    # First, connect to an API endpoint via the Keystone authorization service
    #
    use OpenStack::Client::Auth ();

    my $auth = OpenStack::Client::Auth->new('http://openstack.foo.bar:5000/v2.0',
        'tenant'   => $ENV{'OS_TENANT_NAME'},
        'username' => $ENV{'OS_USERNAME'},
        'password' => $ENV{'OS_PASSWORD'}
    );

    my $glance = $auth->service('image',
        'region' => $ENV{'OS_REGION_NAME'}
    );

    my @images = $glance->all('/v2/images', 'images');

    #
    # Or, connect directly to an API endpoint by URI
    #
    use OpenStack::Client ();

    my $glance = OpenStack::Client->new('http://glance.foo.bar:9292',
        'token' => {
            'id' => 'foo'
        }
    );

    my @images = $glance->all('/v2/images', 'images');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<OpenStack::Client> is a no-frills OpenStack API client which provides generic
access to OpenStack APIs with minimal remote service discovery facilities; with
a minimal client, the key understanding of the remote services are primarily
predicated on an understanding of the authoritative OpenStack API documentation:

    http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref.html

Authorization, authentication, and access to OpenStack services such as the
OpenStack Compute and Networking APIs is made convenient by
L<OpenStack::Client::Auth>.  Further, some small handling of response body data
such as obtaining the full resultset of a paginated response is handled for
convenience.

Ordinarily, a client can be obtained conveniently by using the C<services()>
method on a L<OpenStack::Client::Auth> object.

=head1 INSTANTIATION

=over

=item C<OpenStack::Client-E<gt>new(I<$endpoint>, I<%opts>)>

Create a new C<OpenStack::Client> object connected to the specified
I<$endpoint>.  The following values may be specified in I<%opts>:

=over

=item * B<token>

A token obtained from a L<OpenStack::Client::Auth> object.

=back

=cut

sub new ($%) {
    my ($class, $endpoint, %opts) = @_;

    die('No API endpoint provided') unless $endpoint;

    $opts{'package_ua'}      ||= 'LWP::UserAgent';
    $opts{'package_request'} ||= 'HTTP::Request';

    my $ua = $opts{'package_ua'}->new(
        'ssl_opts' => {
            'verify_hostname' => 0
        }
    );

    return bless {
        'package_ua'      => $opts{'package_ua'},
        'package_request' => $opts{'package_request'},
        'ua'              => $ua,
        'endpoint'        => $endpoint,
        'token'           => $opts{'token'}
    }, $class;
}

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

These methods are useful for identifying key attributes of an OpenStack service
endpoint client.

=over

=item C<$client-E<gt>endpoint()>

Return the absolute HTTP URI to the endpoint this client provides access to.

=cut

sub endpoint ($) {
    shift->{'endpoint'};
}

=item C<$client-E<gt>token()>

If a token object was specified when creating C<$client>, then return it.

=cut

sub token ($) {
    shift->{'token'};
}

sub uri ($$) {
    my ($self, $path) = @_;

    return join '/', map {
        my $part = $_;

        $part =~ s/^\///;
        $part =~ s/\/$//;
        $part
    } $self->{'endpoint'}, $path;
}

=back

=head1 PERFORMING REMOTE CALLS

=over

=item C<$client-E<gt>call(I<$method>, I<$path>, I<$body>)>

Perform a call to the service endpoint using the HTTP method I<$method>,
accessing the resource I<$path> (relative to the absolute endpoint URI), passing
an arbitrary value in I<$body> that is to be encoded to JSON as a request
body.  This method may return the following:

=over

=item * For B<application/json>: A decoded JSON object

=item * For other response types: The unmodified response body

=back

=item C<$client-E<gt>call(I<$method>, I<$headers>, I<$path>, I<$body>)>

There exists a second form of C<call> that allows one to pass in
I<$headers> as an optional input parameter (hash reference), which
allows one to directly modify the following headers sent along with
the request; when used, I<$headers> must be placed in the second
position after I<$method>.

=over

=item Accept

Defaults to C<application/json, text/plain>.

=item Accept-Encoding

Defaults to C<identity, gzip, deflate, compress>.

=item Content-Type

Defaults to C<application/json>, although some API calls (e.g., a PATCH)
expect a different type; the the case of an image update, the expected
type is C<application/openstack-images-v2.1-json-patch> or some version
thereof.

For example, the following shows how one may update image metadata using
the PATCH method supported by version 2 of the Image API. 

In the example, C<@image_updates> is an array of hash references of the
structure defined by the PATCH RFC (6902) governing "JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON) Patch"; i.e., operations consisting of C<add>, C<replace>,
or C<delete>.

  my $headers  = { 'Content-Type' => 'application/openstack-images-v2.1-json-patch' };
  my $response = $glance->call( q{PATCH}, $headers, qq[/v2/images/$image->{id}], \@image_updates )

=back

And except for C<X-Auth-Token>, any additional token will be added to the request.

In exceptional conditions (such as when the service returns a 4xx or 5xx HTTP
response), the client will C<die()> with the raw text response from the HTTP
service, indicating the nature of the service-side failure to service the
current call.
